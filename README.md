# Anarchy-Chess
A simple chess engine that supports the anarchy chess rules and provides an clean interface for the addition of new complex pieces.

Note: This project is still in the early stages of development and is far from complete. 
Currently, only a single module is complete which is not nearly enough to play a game, so running anarchy-chess_build.exe will not do anything usefull.
A full, detailed list of features will appear here once the project is complete (MVP).

To run, build the project with CMake and run ./build/src/anarchy-chess_build.exe

To run tests, build the project with CMake and run ./build/test/anarchy-chess_tests.exe
